# ExtinctLLM

An ultra-lightweight AI content blocker browser extension powered by regex-based pattern matching and designed with both efficiency and accuracy in mind.
It has an **average precision of up to 80-90%** in correctly classifying human text, and an **average precision of ~70%** in detecting an AI corpus.

## The Problem

Traditional AI content detectors rely on either heavy **machine learning** (ML) and/or **intensive pretraining** for a basic classifier model, which are far from ideal for a mere browser extension.
They usually measure values such as perplexity, burstiness, and token probability patterns to determine whether or not a text is generated by AI.
Although, admittedly, regex-based detection cannot be as precise as ML-based detection, it can reach satisfactory levels when certain exceptions/limitations are implemented.

## How It Works

This section explains ExtinctLLM's algorithm and how it classifies text as either human- or AI-written.

### Point-Based Pattern Matching

ExtinctLLM uses a precompiled list of regular expressions, with each regex assigned a certain "point" value depending on how common it appears in typical AI-generated content.

- Some regexes have a **negative** score. A negative score indicates that the pattern is more common in human text than in AI text.
  - This helps increase accuracy by limiting the impact of outliers in the content.
